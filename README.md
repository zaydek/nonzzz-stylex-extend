## Early support for `inline` or `atom` in StyleX

This repo aims to demonstrate what it might feel like to mix-and-match the conventional StyleX stylesheet API with inline styles made possibly by @nonzzz's packages:

```
@stylex-extend/core
@stylex-extend/react
vite-plugin-stylex-dev
```

## Try it yourself

Clone this repo and install the NPM dependencies using `npm i` or equivalent. Then run `npm run dev` to start the development server. You can also run `npm run build` to build the distribution directory `dist`.
