## Early support for `inline` or `atom` in StyleX

This repo aims to demonstrate what it might feel like to mix-and-match the conventional StyleX stylesheet API with inline styles made possibly by [@nonzzz](https://github.com/nonzzz)'s packages:

```
@stylex-extend/core
@stylex-extend/react
vite-plugin-stylex-dev
```

This repo relates to the StyleX issue: [[RFC] Defining styles inline #534](https://github.com/facebook/stylex/issues/534).

## Try it yourself

Clone this repo and install the NPM dependencies using `npm i` or equivalent. Then run `npm run dev` to start the development server. You can also run `npm run build` to build the distribution directory `dist`.
